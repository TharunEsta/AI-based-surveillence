# AI-based-surveillence
This project implements a real-time video surveillance system leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. It features:

Real-time object detection using YOLOv8

Multi-object tracking with DeepSort

Motion detection and unusual activity alerts (customizable)

Optional license plate recognition using OCR (future enhancement)

The system processes live video feed from a webcam or IP camera, detects and tracks people and objects, and can trigger alerts based on predefined rules. Built with Python and popular open-source libraries like OpenCV, PyTorch, and Ultralytics YOLO.
